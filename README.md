Hi there 👋 I’m Demair — an IT Professional 


I am an aspiring IT professional with hands-on experience in Windows administration, cloud infrastructure, networking fundamentals, and help desk operations. I build and document real-world lab environments using Microsoft Azure, Active Directory, and ticketing systems to develop practical troubleshooting and systems operations skills. My focus is on understanding how enterprise IT systems function end-to-end while applying security and operational best practices.
